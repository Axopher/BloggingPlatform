Some more features are yet to be added here like:
                                                  1) User Profile
                                                  2) Notifications on the Front End
                                                  3) Likes on the post
                                                  4) Blogs Category and category related searches
                                                  5) and so on.
But since, time was of the essence here. I started this project from Sunday(March 19th) and had to meet the deadline on March 22nd(Wednesday).
So, I was unable to do everything I wanted here. I was also not able to include some of the bonus points features. So, do not judge me entirely
based on this project which I have done in four days.
